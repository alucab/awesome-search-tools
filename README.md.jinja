# Awesome Search Tools & Libraries

The following is a list of search tools and libraries useful to implement information retrieval in process or as an external component. Every component selected has to be Open Source or with a reasonable free tier if delivered in Saas mode.
I started this catalog as there are only Elastic Search or Algolia pages while plenty of interesting and lighter alternatives do exist.
